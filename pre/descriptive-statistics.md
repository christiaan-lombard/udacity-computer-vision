## Research Methods

The **experimental method** is a systematic and scientific approach to research in which the researcher manipulates one or more variables, and controls and measures any change in other variables.

This is an experiment where the researcher manipulates one **variable**, and control/randomizes the rest of the variables. It has a **control group**, the **subjects** have been randomly assigned between the groups, and the researcher only tests one effect at a time. It is also important to know what variable(s) you want to test and measure.

Experiments are conducted to be able to predict phenomenons. Typically, an experiment is constructed to be able to explain some kind of **causation**.

### Hypothesis

A research hypothesis (H<sub>1</sub>) is the statement created by researchers when they speculate upon the outcome of a research or experiment.

Your hypothesis should...

 - Be written in clear, concise language
 - Have both an independent and dependent variable
 - Be falsifiable – is it possible to prove or disprove the statement?
 - Make a prediction or speculate on an outcome
 - Be practicable – can you measure the variables in question?
 - Hypothesize about a proposed relationship between two variables, or an intervention into this relationship

### Construct

The construct is a proposed attribute of a person that often cannot be measured directly, but can be assessed using a number of indicators or manifest variables. Constructs are also discussed under other labels, such as theoretical constructs or latent variables, which are interchangeable terms.

### Operational Definition

An operational definition, when applied to data collection, is a clear, concise detailed definition of a measure. The need for operational definitions is fundamental when collecting all types of data. It is particularly important when a decision is being made about whether something is correct or incorrect, or when a visual check is being made where there is room for confusion.


### Variables

   - **Independent Variable** - An independent variable is the variable that is changed or controlled in a scientific experiment to test the effects on the dependent variable.
   - **Dependent Variable** - A dependent variable is the variable being tested and measured in a scientific experiment.
   - **Extraneous Variables** - Extraneous variables are any variables that you are not intentionally studying in your experiment or test. When you run an experiment, you're looking to see if one variable (the independent variable) has an effect on another variable (the dependent variable). These undesirable variables are called extraneous variables.


### Relationship

Relationships in probability and statistics can generally be one of three things: deterministic, random, or statistical. A statistical relationship is a mixture of deterministic and random relationships.

 - **Deterministic Relationship** - A deterministic relationship involves an exact relationship between two variables.
 - **Random Relationship** - A random relationship is a bit of a misnomer, because there is no relationship between the variables.
 - **Statistical Relationship** - A statistical relationship is a mixture of the above two relationships. It’s a relationship that’s part deterministic, and part random.
 - **Causal Relationship** - Causation indicates that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; i.e. there is a causal relationship between the two events.

## Statistics

A **statistic** (singular) or sample **statistic** is a single measure of some attribute of a sample (e.g. its arithmetic mean value). It is calculated by applying a function (statistical algorithm) to the values of the items of the sample, which are known together as a set of data.

### Population

### Sample Size


### Correlation

*Correlation is a measure of the strength of the relationship between two variables.*

Correlation is a statistical measure (expressed as a number) that describes the size and direction of a relationship between two or more variables. A correlation between variables, however, does not automatically mean that the change in one variable is the cause of the change in the values of the other variable.

 - **Positive Correlation** - Positive correlation is a relationship between two variables in which both variables move in tandem. A positive correlation exists when one variable decreases as the other variable decreases, or one variable increases while the other increases.
 - **Negative Correlation** - Negative correlation is a relationship between two variables in which one variable increases as the other decreases, and vice versa.

The **correlation coefficient** quantifies the degree of change of one variable based on the change of the other variable.

### Sampling Error

In statistics, sampling error is the error caused by observing a sample instead of the whole population. The sampling error is the difference between a sample statistic used to estimate a population parameter and the actual but unknown value of the parameter.
